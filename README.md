# Type-Safe Fetch

Given a path and a method, the TypeScript compiler will guarantee that you are passing the correct path and query parameters, and the correct body (and only if needed).

> Warning! This is alpha software and will very likely still change significantly before the 1.0.0 release - use only to test the capabilities and suggest improvements.

## Demo

> Using typesafe-fetch with the Petstore demo API in VS Code to see the compiler suggested completions.

## Usage

Install:
```
npm install typesafe-fetch

yarn add typesafe-fetch
```

Setup:

```ts
import getSafeFetch from 'typesafe-fetch';

import { paths as ApiDefinition } from "./petstore";

// Now set up using your existing OpenAPI definition
const safeFetch = getSafeFetch<ApiDefinition>({
  fetch, // define which fetch function to use
});

// Make API calls :)
const res = safeFetch('/endpoint', {
  query: {
    sampleParam: 123,
  },
});
```

## Generating the API models

This library relies on the TS models generated by [OpenAPI-TypeScript](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript)

For the simplest way to generate the models run:

```
npx openapi-typescript https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json --output schema.ts
```
